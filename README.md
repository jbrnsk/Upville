# Upville

Welcome to Upville! This is a tactical turn-based game developed in Unity. 

The GitHub repository is open-source. Feel free to download it, learn from it, and follow along with our development streams that generally occur on Twitch Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights at 8 PM EST:

But preferably don't steal it, because that would be, like, rude.

We release a weekly podcast discussing the progress on Spotify and Apple Podcasts, which is called JV Game Dev:
